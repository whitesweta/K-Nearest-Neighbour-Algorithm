 implementation of the (K-)Nearest Neighbour algorithm, and evaluates iris data:
  - data set is taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (http://mlearn.ics.uci.edu/MLRepository.html). Contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant. There are four numeric attributes: sepal length in cm, sepal width in cm, petal length in cm, and petal width in cm.
  
Program classifies each instance in the test set iris-test.txt according to the training set iris-training.txt. Takes two file names as command line arguments, and classifies  each instance in the test
set (the second file name) according to the training set (the first file name).

to run, insert the iris-training as the first argument and and iris-test as the second and run the main class
